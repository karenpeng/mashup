<p>Mash Up is a class in ITP NYU with teacher <a href="https://github.com/craigprotzel">Craig Protzel</a>.</p>
<p>This class is about building interactive single-page web applications that leverage public data from a range of existing web services. The overall goal of the class will be for each student to have 3 functional well-designed single-page web applications by end of semester. Much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, mostly Javascript, for front-end (in-browser) web development. We will use a number of frameworks, including JQuery, Underscore, PaperJs, and D3. Where backend work is required, we will use Node-Express. Students should have some programming experience (ICM) as well as a basic understanding of web development (Comm Lab Web). Experience with Javascript is a plus.</p>
